# **Revolutionizing Customer Support with Forethought AI**

## **Overview and Origin**
> “Forethought AI’s mission to revolutionize customer support through AI-driven solutions is reshaping the industry.”
Forethought AI, incorporated in 2017 and founded by Deon Nicholas and Sami Ghoche, was established to address inefficiencies in customer support by leveraging artificial intelligence to enhance response times and overall customer experience. Reflecting on the company’s origins, Ghoche explained:
>*”Deon and I started Forethought because we saw a once-in-a-generation opportunity with the advent of transformer models in 2017 (the precursor to GPT). Having both been immersed in AI, we knew this technology was a game changer. At the same time, we had firsthand experience with how information bottlenecks can cripple companies as they scale.
Our vision was to enable businesses to scale more efficiently while delivering proactive, personalized support experiences for their customers—solving problems before they even arise. That’s why we called our company Forethought: to empower companies to act with foresight and intelligence in every customer interaction.”*
    As of December 2021, Forethought AI has raised approximately **$92 million**. A significant portion of that funding was through venture capital funds, with **$65 million** raised by Steadfast Capital Ventures (Business Wire).

## **Business Activities:**
**Forethought AI addresses four critical challenges** in customer support: high response times, lack of agent efficiency, poor customer experience (CSAT), and the difficulty of managing fluctuating support demands (Craft.co). Its primary clients include customer support teams across industries, including SaaS, travel, and e-commerce. Forethought operates within the rapidly expanding global contact center software market, projected to reach **$60.4 billion by 2027**, with a compound annual growth rate of 14.3% (Pitchbook). The company sets itself apart with AI-driven Automation tools like ***Solve, Discover, Assist, and Analyze***, which improve customer experiences by providing quick responses, automating tasks through API integrations, and identifying gaps in knowledge or processes. These tools also generate AI-driven knowledge articles and process documents to address these gaps, while offering actionable insights based on customer and agent behavior (Forehtought.ai). 

## **Landscape:**
Forethought AI works in the Customer Support AI field, which has seen significant progress, such as the adoption of generative AI to improve customer engagement. Generative AI, such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT, has revolutionized customer engagement by enabling dynamic, personalized interactions and improving overall user satisfaction (OpenAI). Similarly, Salesforce’s Einstein AI has introduced intelligent features like real-time recommendations and predictive analytics to enhance agent performance and streamline workflows. For example, Einstein AI provides customer service agents with ‘Next Best Actions,’ which suggest context-specific steps to resolve issues more efficiently (Salesforce). These innovations demonstrate how generative and predictive AI is transforming the way businesses manage customer support, making processes more efficient and improving customer outcomes. Forethought AI leverages similar trends, positioning itself as a competitive player in this evolving landscape (Forethought.ai).

## **Results:**
Forethought AI has significantly improved customer support by reducing response times, enhancing agent efficiency, and increasing customer satisfaction, all while lowering operations costs for support teams. (Forethought.ai). This progress is reflected in key metrics like short resolution times, better customer satisfaction scores (CSAT), and higher first contact resolution (FCR) rates (Craft.co). Compared to its competitors, Forethought AI stands out for its advanced automation and accurate AI solutions, making it a leader in customer support technology (Pitchbook).

## **Recommendations:**
Forethought AI could integrate tools for real-time AI recommendations, similar to Salesforce’s Next Best Actions. These tools could suggest optimal next steps based on customer history and context, improving efficiency and resolution rates (Salesforce) Additionally, Forethought AI could enhance its chatbot capabilities by adopting features similar to Ada’s AI-powered platform. Ada enables personalized, self-service interactions by delivering actionable recommendations directly to customers based on their interaction history and behavior (Influencer Marketing Hub). For instance, Forethought’s chatbot could guide customers to relevant solutions or escalate issues to agents only when necessary, reducing agent workload and improving customer satisfaction. Leveraging predictive analytics and real-time monitoring, as demonstrated by Ada, would align well with Forethought AI’s mission to innovate in customer support, ensuring competitive and efficient service delivery (Forethought.ai).
